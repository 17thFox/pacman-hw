Just a small PacMan homework

Given a map containing a labyrinth with walls ‚õ∞, empty tiles, food tiles üçí, two ghosts üëª and a player üò∫ (PacMan),
calculate the sequence of moves for the player character using the Minimax algorithm using the provided
scoring function.

On each turn first the player character moves and then the two ghosts move as well. The algorithm for
moving the ghosts is as follows: ghosts may select a random adjecent empty or food tile as long as it
is not the one they occupied the previous turn, with the exception when there is no other tile avaliable.

The starting score is 0 and it is required to display the moves and events that happen on each turn until
either the player eats all the food or one of the ghosts eat the player character. The output should be 
similar to the format:

```
Turn x:
 - player moves to [col,row] (score: x.yy)
 - player eats a piece of food, score is now y
 - ghost 1 moves to [col,row]
 - ghost 2 moves to [col,row]
 
Turn z:
 - player moves to [col,row] (score: x.yy)
 - player eats a piece of food, score is now y
 - ghost 1 moves to [col,row]
 - ghost 1 eats player character
 - ghosts win - GAME OVER

...
```

00000000000000000000
```

Tile types:
 * `0` - wall
 * `1` - empty tile
 * `2` - food
 * `3` - ghost starting position
 * `4` - player starting position

Minimax scoring function:
```
score = 1 * current_score 
        - 1.5 * distance_to(closest_food_tile)
        - 2 / distance_to(closest_ghost_position)
        - 4 * count(food_tiles)
```

You can use either Python or JavaScript (either server- or client-side) to implement the game.
Client-side JS is preferred since that would imply also using a bit of interactivity and user
interface design.

For extra credit:
 - use a depth larger than 1 for the Minimax algorithm (3 for example)
 - if writing client-side JS, implement a UI (use a `<table>` for example) for displaying 
   the current status of the game as well as a log for each turn; add a button to trigger
   the end of the turn; feel free to use any JS library like jQuery or Underscore.js;
   _a skeleton file will be provided for this_
